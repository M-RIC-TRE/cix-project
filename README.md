# Mental Health Research and Innovation Centre
## WP1 Combined Intelligence for Translational Health Research 

Combined Intelligence for Translational Health Research (CIX) is the data, analytics and trials’ management environment that will enable Mental Health Research and Innovation Centre (M-RIC) to deliver a mental health learning system at civic scale. CIX will build on core-business NHS/CDC infrastructure for research to avoid duplication of effort, improve opportunities for service-users to participate in trials and provide quicker turnaround-times for industry partners, eg for feasibility analyses. CIX will link and organise data to be research-ready, using not only the data from ICS shared-care records and extracting information from other sources, eg, text-mining psychiatric notes, analysing brain images and organising data on patterns of behaviour into useful phenotypes not captured by traditional diagnoses. 

Work Package Objectives (24 months)
* Build the CIX data infrastructure initially for ten workspaces and five trials
* Establish CIX information governance standard operating procedures
* Deploy CIX in MCFT with Microsoft to NHS England TRE standards with open-source technologies, building on a year’s preparation of a blueprint replicable/networkable across UK mental health services, and with (sub)national NHS data services
* Enhance mental health dataflows into CIPHA (then CIX for research), including social prescribing, environmental, genomic, imaging and person-captured data (eg wearables) closing the action-research loop
